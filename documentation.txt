step #1 : connect node.js and connect DB properly.
Step #3 :Take a folder named database and inside it create a file named dbConnection.js. In this file take all the connection elements like mongoose. dbConnection part take inside a function for export it. Then import dbCollection in the main.js file. Be carefule about whether it is linked at the top part of the code.  

step #3 : (dotenv) To keep the databaseconnection secret elements in more professonal way we can follow the following steps. 
(run)  npm i dotenv
make a file in the root named (.env)
take require env with config in main.js file.
in the file .env put:
DB_USER_NAME = ecommerceapi
DB_Password = .....
DB_NAME = ......

put in the connection url
${process.env.DB_USER_NAME}
${process.env.DB_Password}
${process.env.DB_NAME}

then use backtick in the connection code and then the light will become on. 

2nd way to make dbConnection more professonal: 
in the .env file write: 
DB_URL = all connection code here and in the dbConnection file write    `${process.env.DB_URL}`

Step #4: (API make)
We have to make seperate route for a individual api. 
Make a route in the root > file index.js

import express
import router from express

make a folder named api under the route.
make an index.js file under api folder
import require express 
import require Router

router.use("/api/v1, (req, res)=>{

})

To make an api make a api folder under route.
under api filder make one index.js file
