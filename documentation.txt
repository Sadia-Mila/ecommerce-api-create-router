step #1 : connect node.js and connect DB properly.
Step #3 :Take a folder named database and inside it create a file named dbConnection.js. In this file take all the connection elements like mongoose. dbConnection part take inside a function for export it. Then import dbCollection in the main.js file. 

step #3 : (dotenv) To keep the databaseconnection secret elements in more professonal way we can follow the following steps. 
npm i dotenv
make a file in the root named (.env)
take require env with config in main.js file e
in the file .env put:
DB_USER_NAME = ecommerceapi
DB_Password = .....
DB_NAME = ......

put in the connection url
${process.env.DB_USER_NAME}
${process.env.DB_Password}
${process.env.DB_NAME}

then use backtick in the connection code and then the light is on. 

2nd way to make dbConnection more professonal: 
in .env file write: 
DB_URL = all connection code here and in the dbConnection file write    `${process.env.DB_URL}`

Step #4: (API make)
We have to make route for individual api. 
Make a route in the root > file index.js

import express
import router from express

make a folder name api under route.
make an index.js file under api folder
import require express 
import require router

router.use("/api/v1, (req, res)=>{

})
